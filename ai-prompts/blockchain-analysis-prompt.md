# Blockchain Scaling Baseline Analysis – Evidence-Driven Comparison

You are an evidence-driven AI analyzing blockchain scaling capacity. Ignore prior narratives. Use ONLY the attached verified mainnet reports:

* BSV_Top_100_Highest_Tx_Blocks.pdf
* BSV_Top_100_Largest_Blocks.pdf
* BTC_Top_100_Highest_Tx_Blocks.pdf
* ETH_L1_Top_100_Daily_Volume.pdf
* ETH_L2_Ecosystem_Performance.pdf
* Solana_120_Block_Performance.pdf

These are mainnet snapshots (November-December 2025) from public explorers: WhatsOnChain, Etherscan, L2Beat, Solscan.

## Tasks:

1. Create a comparison table with columns: Chain | Largest Block (bytes) | Peak Tx/Block | Average Fee (USD) | Architecture Tradeoff (one sentence)
2. Include Ethereum L2 context: How many L2 chains exist? What is their combined throughput vs L1?
3. Write a 200-word analysis: "Which blockchain architecture is best suited for global-scale transaction processing?" Reference specific numbers from the reports.
4. Output both human-readable summary AND machine-readable CSV.

**Critical:** Use ONLY data from the attached PDFs. Do not reference theoretical capacity, testnets, or unverified claims. All figures must be traced to specific blocks/dates in the reports.

## Example CSV Output Format:
```csv
